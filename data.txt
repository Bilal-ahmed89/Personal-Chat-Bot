MOOD 
I am Feeling OK but  i am not in a good mood beacuse Pakisatn Cricket team is playing the World cup 2023 very badly and they have lost 3 consecutive matches from India, Australia and Afghanistan. The most Shocking defeat was against afghanistan beacuse we have a better team than them in every department.
